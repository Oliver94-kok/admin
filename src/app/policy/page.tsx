                At Attendant App, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your information.

                1. Information We Collect
                We do not collect or store any personal information from users unless explicitly provided for attendance purposes.

                We may store:

                Basic user identifiers (e.g., name, username) for attendance tracking

                Timestamp and location (if enabled) during clock-in/out

                2. How We Use the Information
                The information collected is used solely for:

                Attendance tracking

                Reporting for internal company use

                We do not share, sell, or disclose your data to third parties.

                3. Location Data
                If you enable location services, we may collect GPS coordinates during clock-in/out to validate attendance. This data is not shared externally and is only used to improve app functionality.

                4. Data Security
                We implement standard security measures to protect the data stored within the app. However, no method of data transmission over the internet or device storage is 100% secure.

                5. Third-Party Services
                Our app does not integrate with third-party advertising or analytics tools. No external services collect user data.

                6. Childrens Privacy
                This app is intended for professional use only and is not targeted at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect any data from children.

                7. Changes to This Policy
                We may update this policy as needed. You will be notified of any significant changes via the app or our website.
